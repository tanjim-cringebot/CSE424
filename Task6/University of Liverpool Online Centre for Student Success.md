Here are the learnings from the University of Liverpool Online Centre for Student Success's series of videos on writing for publication, using advanced information skills, managing your research project, intercultural communication and collaboration, tips to improve academic writing, and the place of theory in your dissertation:

2. Using advanced information skills involves being able to effectively locate, evaluate, and use research sources and data in your work. This includes being familiar with different types of sources, using search strategies and databases effectively, and citing your sources correctly.

3. Managing your research project involves setting clear goals and a plan for achieving them, staying organized and on track, and being flexible and open to adjusting your plan as needed. It's also important to budget your time effectively and to seek feedback and support as needed.

4. Intercultural communication and collaboration involves being aware of and respectful of cultural differences and being able to effectively communicate and work with people from diverse backgrounds. This includes being aware of language barriers and cultural expectations and being open to learning from others.

5. Tips to improve academic writing include being clear and concise, using an appropriate style and tone, and carefully organizing and structuring your work. It's also important to proofread and revise your writing, and to seek feedback from others.

6. The place of theory in your dissertation involves using theoretical frameworks to guide your research and to help you understand and interpret your findings. It's important to carefully select and justify your choice of theory, and to explain how it informs your work.
